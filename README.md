# üîê Cryptography Repository

Welcome to the Cryptography repository! This project explores various cryptographic techniques, including classical and modern encryption methods. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, this repo serves as a hands-on learning resource for implementing secure communication techniques.

## üöÄ First Task: Caesar Cipher

The Caesar Cipher is one of the simplest encryption techniques, shifting letters in the alphabet by a fixed number of places. It was historically used by Julius Caesar for securing messages.

- **Encryption:** Shifts each letter forward by a given key.
- **Decryption:** Shifts each letter backward by the same key.
- **Implementation:** You can find the Caesar Cipher implementation inside the repository.

## üìå Upcoming Tasks:

- Vigen√®re Cipher
- RSA Encryption
- Hashing Algorithms (SHA, MD5)
- Symmetric & Asymmetric Cryptography

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the first task:

   ```bash
   cd CaesarCipher
   ```

3. Run the encryption/decryption script.
